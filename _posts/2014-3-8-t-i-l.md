When I started learning ruby, what really intrigued me was the fact that 99% of the time I didn't know how to do something, I could just guess, and it ended up being right (or close to it).

Every once and a while though, I run into something that makes me scratch my head.  

For example, take a look at the following code snippet:

{% highlight ruby %}
  x = true && false
  # => false
  x
  # => false
  x = true and false
  # => false
  x
  # => true
{% endhighlight %}

Wait, how is that possible? The problem here is that unlike &&, 'and' has a lower operator precedence than '=', and thus:
{% highlight ruby %}
  x = true and false 
  # => (x = true) and false
{% endhighlight %}

While the line returns false (as expected), we end up assigning true to x.
